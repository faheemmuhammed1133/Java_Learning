1.WAP to demonstrate implicit type conversion and explicit type conversion.
2. WAP to find whether the inputted number is even or odd.
3. WAP to find greater among two numbers using conditional operator.
4. WAP to find greatest among three numbers using if else.
5. WAP to find sum and average of numbers from 1 to 10.
6. Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. It should then print the
multiplication table of that number.
7. WAP to find greatest among three numbers using conditional operator.
8. WAP to print odd numbers between 1 to 20.
9. WAP to find whether a number is prime or not.
10. Write a Java Program find out Students Grades using Switch Case

11. WAP to check whether the inputted character is Vowel or Consonant.
12. WAP to check whether the inputted number is Armstrong Number or not. (Hint:
An Armstrong number is a positive m-digit number that is equal to the sum of the mth powers
of their digits. It is also known as pluperfect, or Plus Perfect, or Narcissistic number.
153: 13 + 53 + 33 = 1 + 125+ 27 = 153 (An Armstrong Number),
125: 13 + 23 + 53 = 1 + 8 + 125 = 134 (Not an Armstrong Number)
Hint: use Math.pow(num1, num2) to calculate power
13. Write a program that generates a random number between 1 to 100 and asks the user to guess
what the number is. If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program should
display "Too high, try again." If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the program
should display "Too low, try again." The program should use a loop that repeats until the user
correctly guesses the random number (Hint: use Math.random() for generating random number.
Eg. number = (int) (Math.random() * 100) + 1;).
14. WAP to find average of consecutive N Odd numbers and even numbers.
15. WAP to reverse a positive number.
